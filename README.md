# ESL Word Scramble Challenge

Simple, interactive ESL game where students unscramble letters to form a word.

Files
- `index.html` — Game UI and structure.
- `style.css` — Styles for a modern, responsive layout.
- `script.js` — Game logic (scramble, check, score, timer).

How to run locally
1. Open `index.html` in a browser. For a better developer experience, use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub.
2. Upload the three files or push them from your local git repo.
3. In the repository Settings → Pages, set Source to the `main` branch (or `master`) and root (`/`).
4. Save and wait a few minutes. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

Notes
- The game has a 60-second timer, scoring ( +10 correct, -2 wrong ), and simple hints for each word.
- To extend: add more words, difficulty levels, sound effects, or categories.
